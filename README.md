# Game Plan Generator

## Problem Statement

In the world of football, team formation and player selection are crucial factors in determining a team's success on the pitch. Many teams struggle with identifying the optimal formation and the best combination of players to field in order to maximize performance, whether it's points per match or overall player balance. This project aims to address that gap by building a "Game Plan Generator" — a Streamlit app that helps users create an optimal formation and predict a team's expected performance metrics based on player selection.

## Research Question

The core question driving this project is:

*"What is the best team formation and player combination that can maximize performance, in terms of predicted points per match and balanced performance metrics?"*

This app seeks to provide football enthusiasts, analysts, and coaches with data-driven insights on which player combinations and formations yield the best expected results.

## Executive Summary

### Introduction
The Game Plan Generator provides a practical interface for users to simulate different football team formations, select individual players, and understand how these selections impact team performance. Using machine learning models trained on Premier League club statistics and individual player stats, the app calculates the expected points per match and balanced player performance, providing insights on which players fit well together and which formation would yield the best outcome.

### Data Collection and Processing
The project used player-level and club-level datasets:

- **Player Dataset:** Contains filtered individual player statistics from the Premier League.
- **Club Dataset:** Contains club-level aggregated data and statistics that serve as features for predicting points per match (Pts/MP).

Key data cleaning and preparation steps:
- **Dropping Redundant Features:** Removed columns like Player Name, Nation, Team, etc., to prevent data leakage during training.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Categorical features were converted using `pd.get_dummies()` to prepare data for modeling.
- **Splitting Data:** Data was split into training and testing sets for both the team and player models.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to gain insights into the data distribution and correlations among various features:

- **Team Performance vs. Formation:** Correlations between team formations and total points were examined.
- **Player Attributes:** Different player roles (FW, MF, DF) were analyzed in relation to their balanced performance metrics.

### Model Development
Two main models were developed for this project:

1. **Club Model (XGBoost):** Predicts the points per match for different team formations and player combinations.
2. **Player Model (Linear Regression):** Predicts individual balanced performance metrics.

**Models Evaluated:**
- **Linear Regression** for predicting player performance.
- **XGBoost Regressor** for predicting the overall club performance based on the selected team.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² were used to assess model performance on training and test datasets.

### Model Evaluation and Performance
Summary of model performance metrics for the chosen algorithms:

- **Linear Regression (Player Model):** Achieved consistent predictions with an acceptable RMSE.
- **XGBoost (Club Model):** Outperformed other models in terms of predicting points per match, with an R² score of 0.95 and a very low RMSE.
